IGNORE FOR NOW
- DAG
- some easy prior stuff

Data for Stan
Y - vector event counts data - see line 59 get_likelihood_helpers
max_possible_data - matrix of all possible fundamental data realizations
w_starts - starts for each strategy
w_ends - ends for each strategy
A_w - ambiguity to build out L
n_strategies - number of strategies

A - ambiguity matrix that maps endogenous types to observable data at fundamental level
n_endog - the number of endogenous nodes in the dag
n_exog - the number of endogenous nodes in the dag

lambda_prior - ragged array / list / vector of dirichlet priors (alphas)

pi_times - vector as long as n_exog, that tells us how many times to rep
pi_each - vector as long as n_exog, that tells us how many each to rep
max_possible_data - a matrix we feed in, tells us which combinations of data are possible
pi_prior - vector, as long as the number of exogenous variables, times each exogenous variables' number of endogenous children types
  - need alpha and beta for beta distribution (priors over probability)


Parameters in Stan
L - vector of combinations of all endogenous types 
lambda - vector of vectors that we need to have dirichlet priors over 
pis - vector of vectors, that we have beta priors over
P - matrix created from pis in a loop
